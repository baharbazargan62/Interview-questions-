Question: Can you tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult colleague?

Answer:

S - Situation: In my previous role at ABC Company, I was assigned to a cross-functional project team where I had to collaborate with a colleague who had a reputation for being difficult to work with. This colleague had a strong personality and often disagreed with others, which created tension within the team.

T - Task: Our task as a team was to develop a marketing strategy for a new product launch. It was crucial for the success of the project that we fostered effective collaboration and maintained a positive working environment.

A - Action: Recognizing the importance of achieving our shared objectives, I took the initiative to address the situation. First, I made an effort to understand my colleague's perspective and motivations. I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with them to openly discuss any concerns or challenges they might have had.

During the meeting, I remained calm and focused on the goals of the project and the organization. I actively listened to their concerns and tried to find common ground. I proposed alternative solutions and suggested compromises that would benefit both parties and align with the organization's objectives.

R - Result: Through open and respectful communication, I was able to build a rapport with my difficult colleague. By showing empathy and demonstrating a willingness to understand their perspective, we found common ground and started working more collaboratively. As a result, the tension within the team decreased, and we were able to achieve our project goals successfully. Our marketing strategy received positive feedback from stakeholders, and the product launch was a success.

This example demonstrates that I prioritize the needs of the organization by addressing difficult situations head-on and seeking positive outcomes. It showcases my ability to remain professional, not taking things personally, and focusing on finding solutions that benefit the team and the overall project.
